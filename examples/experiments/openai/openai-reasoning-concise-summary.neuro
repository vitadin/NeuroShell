\echo "Building on optimization strategies from high-effort discussion"
\echo "Message 1: Technology stack decisions"
\echo ""

\send Based on our optimization framework discussion, I need to make concrete technology stack decisions for the churn prediction system. Should I use ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) or deep learning approaches (TabNet, Neural ODEs, Transformer-based models) for the 50k user dataset? Consider factors like interpretability requirements, real-time inference constraints (<100ms), retraining frequency, and the need for feature importance explanations to business stakeholders.

\echo ""
\echo "Response time and thinking analysis:"
\echo "- This should show moderate thinking time with MEDIUM effort"
\echo "- Summary should be AUTO (OpenAI decides best format)"
\echo ""

\echo "Message 2: Infrastructure and deployment architecture"
\send Given the technology choice you recommended, how should I architect the deployment infrastructure? We need to handle real-time scoring for 50k users, scale to 500k within 6 months, maintain <100ms latency, and ensure 99.9% uptime. Should I use containerized microservices (Docker/Kubernetes), serverless functions (Lambda/Cloud Functions), or dedicated ML serving platforms (SageMaker, Vertex AI)? What are the cost implications and operational complexity trade-offs?

\echo ""
\echo "Message 3: Monitoring and maintenance strategy"
\send For the production system architecture you suggested, what monitoring and maintenance strategy would ensure long-term reliability? I need to detect model drift, monitor prediction quality, track business KPIs, and handle the 20% monthly user growth. What specific metrics, alerting thresholds, and automated responses should I implement to minimize manual intervention while ensuring model performance?
