\echo "Building on implementation decisions from concise-summary discussion"
\echo "Message 1: Comprehensive project roadmap"
\echo ""

\send Based on all our previous discussions about churn prediction (initial scope, methodology, optimization, technology stack, and infrastructure), I need you to synthesize everything into a comprehensive 3-month implementation roadmap. The roadmap should prioritize tasks, identify risks, define success metrics, and provide actionable next steps for a team of 4 data scientists and 2 ML engineers with a $10k/month budget. Include specific deliverables for each month, resource allocation, and contingency plans for potential issues we've discussed.

\echo ""
\echo "Response time and thinking analysis:"
\echo "- This should show extended thinking time with HIGH effort"
\echo "- Response should be LIMITED by max_output_tokens=500"
\echo "- This tests how reasoning models handle token constraints"
\echo ""

\echo "Message 2: Risk mitigation strategies"
\send Given the roadmap you provided, what are the top 5 highest-risk aspects of this project, and what specific mitigation strategies would you recommend for each? Consider technical risks (model performance, scalability), business risks (changing requirements, timeline pressure), and operational risks (team capacity, budget constraints). Provide concrete action items for each risk category.

\echo ""
\echo "Message 3: Success measurement and iteration"
\send Finally, how should we measure success at each stage of the project, and what feedback loops should we establish for continuous improvement? Define specific KPIs for technical performance (accuracy, latency, reliability), business impact (churn reduction, ROI, stakeholder satisfaction), and operational excellence (development velocity, maintenance overhead, team productivity). How should we adapt the system based on these measurements?
