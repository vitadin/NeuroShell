=== Send Conversation Flow with Thinking Blocks Test ===
Testing multi-turn conversation with context-aware thinking blocks
Starting conversation about programming...

  Thinking about the user's message: "I'm learning Python programming. Can you
  help me understand variables?". This helps verify the message flow in tests.
  The user sent 1 messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.   
  This is a mocking reply (received 1 messages, last: I'm learning Python     
  programming. Can you help me understand variables?)                         

Asking follow-up question...

  Thinking about the user's message: "What's the difference between local and 
  global variables in Python?". This helps verify the message flow in tests.  
  The user sent 3 messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.   
  This is a mocking reply (received 3 messages, last: What's the difference   
  between local and global variables in Python?)                              

Getting more specific...

  Thinking about the user's message: "Can you show me an example of variable  
  scope issues?". This helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 5
  messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.                   
  This is a mocking reply (received 5 messages, last: Can you show me an      
  example of variable scope issues?)                                          

Adding complexity to the conversation...

  Thinking about the user's message: "How do I avoid common variable scope    
  mistakes in my Python functions?". This helps verify the message flow in    
  tests. The user sent 7 messages total, and I need to provide a helpful      
  response.

  variable scope mistakes in my Python functions?)                            

Final question to test conversation memory...

  Thinking about the user's message: "Based on our discussion about Python    
  variables and scope, what's the best practice for naming variables?". This  
  helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 9 messages total, and 
  I need to provide a helpful response.
