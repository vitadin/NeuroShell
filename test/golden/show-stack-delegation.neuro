%% Test show-stack with actual command delegation patterns
%% This demonstrates stack usage during real NeuroShell command delegation

\set[_echo_command="true"]

\echo === Show-Stack with Command Delegation ===

\echo Step 1: Empty stack initially
\show-stack

\echo
\echo Step 2: Using if command (which delegates via stack)
\set[condition="true"]
%% The \if command will push the target command to stack
\if[condition="${condition}"] \echo "Condition was true"

\echo
\echo Step 3: Using silent command (which uses stack delegation)
%% The \silent command pushes boundary markers and target command
\silent \echo "This message is silenced"

\echo
\echo Step 4: Nested delegation with show-stack visibility
%% Let's create a complex delegation pattern
\try \silent \echo "Nested try-silent execution"
