Testing with long message...
<thinking id="2-1">
Thinking about the user's message: "This is a very long message that contains multiple sentences and ideas to test how the thinking blocks handle longer input text. The message includes various concepts like programming, mathematics, science, and general knowledge questions. It should trigger thinking blocks that can process and reason about longer content while maintaining readability and proper formatting. This tests the system's ability to handle substantial user input without breaking the thinking block rendering or conversation flow.". This helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 1 messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.
