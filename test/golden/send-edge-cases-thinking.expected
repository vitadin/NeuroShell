Testing with long message...

  Thinking about the user's message: "This is a very long message that        
  contains multiple sentences and ideas to test how the thinking blocks handle
  longer input text. The message includes various concepts like programming,  
  mathematics, science, and general knowledge questions. It should trigger    
  thinking blocks that can process and reason about longer content while      
  maintaining readability and proper formatting. This tests the system's      
  ability to handle substantial user input without breaking the thinking block
  rendering or conversation flow.". This helps verify the message flow in     
  tests. The user sent 1 messages total, and I need to provide a helpful      
  response.

Testing with special characters...

  Thinking about the user's message: "Hello! Can you help me understand these 
  symbols: @#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;':\",./<>?~ and √©mojis like caf√©, r√©sum√©,       
  na√Øve?". This helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 3       
  messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.

Testing with code content...

  Thinking about the user's message: "Here's a Python function: def           
  hello_world(): print("Hello, World!") return True. Can you explain how this 
  works?". This helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 5       
  messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.                   
  This is a mocking reply (received 5 messages, last: Here's a Python

Testing with math expressions...

  Thinking about the user's message: "Calculate: (2x + 3y = 15) and (x - y =  
  1) where x, y ‚àà ‚Ñù. Also, what's ‚à´(x¬≤ + 2x + 1)dx?". This helps verify the   
  message flow in tests. The user sent 7 messages total, and I need to provide
  a helpful response.

Testing multiline content...

  \nThinking about the user's message: "This message has multiple lines:\nLine
  1: Introduction\nLine 2: Main content\nLine 3: Conclusion\nHow do you       
  process this structure?". This helps verify the message flow in tests. The  
  user sent 9 messages total, and I need to provide a helpful                 
  response.\n\n\nThis is a mocking reply (received 9 messages, last: This

Testing Unicode and mixed languages...

  Thinking about the user's message: "Hello ‰∏ñÁïå! Bonjour le monde! ¬øH√≥la     
  mundo? –ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç –º–∏—Ä! Can you respond in multiple languages?". This helps      
  verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 11 messages total, and I
