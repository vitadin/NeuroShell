=== Basic Send with Thinking Blocks Test ===
Testing seamless \send workflow with mock LLM thinking blocks
Testing first message...
  --- OpenAI reasoning trace: ---                                             
  Thinking about the user's message: "Hello, can you help me with a simple    
  question?". This helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 1    
  messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.                   
  --- End thinking ---                                                        
  This is a mocking reply (received 1 messages, last: Hello, can you help me  
  with a simple question?)                                                    
Testing follow-up message...
  --- OpenAI reasoning trace: ---                                             
  Thinking about the user's message: "What's the weather like today?". This   
  helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 3 messages total, and 
  I need to provide a helpful response.                                       
  --- End thinking ---                                                        
  This is a mocking reply (received 3 messages, last: What's the weather like 
  today?)                                                                     
Testing third message to verify conversation flow...
  --- OpenAI reasoning trace: ---                                             
  Thinking about the user's message: "Thanks for your help!". This helps      
  verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 5 messages total, and I need
  to provide a helpful response.                                              
  --- End thinking ---                                                        
  This is a mocking reply (received 5 messages, last: Thanks for your help!)
