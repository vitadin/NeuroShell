Testing normal message first...
<thinking id="2-1">
Thinking about the user's message: "Hello, let me start a conversation.". This helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 1 messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.
</thinking>

  This is a mocking reply (received 1 messages, last: Hello, let me start a   
  conversation.)                                                              

Testing rate limit error with partial content...
<thinking id="4-1">
I was thinking about this request, but then encountered a rate limit...
</thinking>

  This is a partial response before hitting rate limit                        

Error (rate_limit_exceeded): Mock rate limit exceeded - please try again later
Testing follow-up after rate limit...
<thinking id="6-1">
Thinking about the user's message: "Can you continue our conversation now?". This helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 5 messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.
</thinking>

  This is a mocking reply (received 5 messages, last: Can you continue our    
  conversation now?)
