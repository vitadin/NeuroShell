Testing \send command with multiple error types and recovery
Step 1: Successful message
<thinking id="2-1">
Thinking about the user's message: "Hello, starting our conversation!". This helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 1 messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.
</thinking>

  This is a mocking reply (received 1 messages, last: Hello, starting our     
  conversation!)                                                              

Step 2: API error scenario
Error (api_request_failed): Mock API request failed for testing purposes
Step 3: Recovery after API error
<thinking id="5-1">
Thinking about the user's message: "This message should work after the API error.". This helps verify the message flow in tests. The user sent 4 messages total, and I need to provide a helpful response.
</thinking>

  This is a mocking reply (received 4 messages, last: This message should work
  after the API error.)                                                       

Step 4: Rate limit with partial content
<thinking id="7-1">
I was thinking about this request, but then encountered a rate limit...
</thinking>

  This is a partial response before hitting rate limit                        

Error (rate_limit_exceeded): Mock rate limit exceeded - please try again later
Step 5: Client configuration error
FATA Script execution failed error="command execution failed: LLM call failed: Mock client configuration error for testing"
