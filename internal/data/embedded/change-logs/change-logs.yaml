    title: "Output System Overhaul, Advanced Debugging Tools, and Enhanced Testing Infrastructure"
    description: "Implemented comprehensive output system refactoring with new theming, styling, and rendering capabilities across all commands. Added show-stack command for execution stack debugging with detailed mode support. Enhanced error handling in send command with comprehensive error scenarios and thinking block integration. Introduced config-path command for configuration management. Significantly expanded testing infrastructure with 87% coverage in shell package and extensive end-to-end test scenarios. Streamlined model catalog by removing unused OpenRouter and Moonshot provider models."
    impact: "Users now benefit from consistent, themed output across all commands with improved readability and styling. The new show-stack command provides powerful debugging capabilities for script execution and error tracking. Enhanced send command provides better error visibility and thinking block integration for reasoning models. Configuration management is simplified with the new config-path command. The expanded testing framework ensures higher reliability and better error handling. The cleanup of unused models reduces complexity while maintaining core functionality."

    title: "Automated Release Pipeline, Enhanced User Experience, and Advanced Debugging Tools"
    description: "Implemented comprehensive GitHub Actions release pipeline with GoReleaser v2 integration for automated cross-platform releases. Added major user experience improvements including .neurorc auto-startup system, clipboard integration, file writing capabilities, and script execution commands. Enhanced debugging infrastructure with network transport logging, thinking block rendering for reasoning models, and comprehensive testing framework expansion. Introduced new model support including Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5 Chat, and improved Gemini integration with structured completions."
    impact: "Users now benefit from automated release distribution across all platforms, seamless startup configuration with .neurorc files, native clipboard operations, enhanced script automation with \\run and \\write commands, and improved debugging visibility for LLM interactions. The release process is fully automated with proper versioning and changelog integration. Development experience is significantly enhanced with expanded testing coverage and debugging tools."

    title: "Session Import/Export, Model Parameter Validation, and Enhanced OpenAI Integration"
    description: "Added comprehensive session import/export system supporting JSON format with full data preservation. Implemented model parameter validation service with detailed parameter cards for all models. Enhanced OpenAI integration with O4 Mini chat/reasoning modes, streaming support, and improved client management. Upgraded neurotest framework with enhanced testing capabilities and new experiment scripts. Improved help command organization by removing quick examples and adding better categorization."
    impact: "Users can now backup/restore entire chat sessions, view detailed model parameters before creation, utilize OpenAI O4 Mini with both chat and reasoning modes, and benefit from more robust testing infrastructure. The help system is cleaner and more organized. Model management includes comprehensive parameter validation and provider catalog ID display."
